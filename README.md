# Machine Learning Workshops

This repository contains the material for the Machine Learning workshops, including model creation and evaluation using Python for models such as SVM, Random Forest, Ensembles, KNN, and ANNs from scratch. 

# Machine Learning Assessment

This folder contains the jupyter notebook with the pdf file for the assessment. In this assessment a singular simple model was created and evaluated on a dataset predicting the class of a battery. Then a grid search was performed to find the best parameters for other models. Finally, the best model was chosen and evaluated using metrics such as precision, recall, and f1-score, with a confusion matrix created to visualise the results.
